# üß† Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on classifying brain tumors from MRI scans using deep learning. The core of this project is the implementation and comparison of various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures built with TensorFlow and Keras. The models are trained to accurately predict one of four categories: **Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, No Tumor,** or **Pituitary Tumor**.

The primary goal is to develop and evaluate robust models for medical image classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of different deep learning approaches in this domain.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Objective**: To train and compare different deep learning models for classifying brain MRI images with high accuracy.  
- **Method**: Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures are designed, trained, and evaluated on a public dataset to compare their performance.  
- **Outcome**: A comparative analysis of trained models capable of distinguishing between three major types of brain tumors and healthy (no tumor) scans.

## üìÅ Dataset

The models were trained on the **Brain Tumor MRI Dataset**, which is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection).

- **Source**: Brain Tumor MRI Dataset on Kaggle  
- **Content**: The dataset consists of thousands of MRI images.  
- **Classes**:
  - Tumor   
  - No Tumor

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Deep Learning**: Pytorch 
- **Data Manipulation**: NumPy  
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **ML Utilities**: Scikit-learn (train-test splitting, metrics)
